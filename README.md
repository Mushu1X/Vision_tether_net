**Pose Estimation Script**
This script performs pose estimation using a model adapted from the URSOnet project. It is designed to work in conjunction with an Unreal Engine simulation 
for rendering and image capture for tether-net based capture.

**Overview**
This pose estimation script is based on the work done in the URSOnet project. It has been modified to integrate with our Unreal Engine TCP simulation 
project for real-time pose data transmission and visualization.

This script is adapted from the UrsoNet.
